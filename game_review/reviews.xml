		<title>Fallout 4</title>
		<link>http://sulley.cah.ucf.edu/~mi853358/dig3134/assignment06/review.php?review_id=2</link>

Its filled with care and attention to detail like the expanded set of radio stations, or the way flash radiation storms bathe the world in a sickly, ominous green hue. It's a pleasure to pick through the world, to discover new sights, and to pick through the perks and customisation option to conceive the perfect character build, however bizarre.</description>
